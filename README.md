# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

**Test the Application Flow**
**Registration Page:** Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser. This should redirect you to the Registration page. Try registering a new user. Ensure that all validation rules work and that the user data is stored in db.json.

**Login Page:** After registration, you should be redirected to the Login page. Test the login functionality, including field validation and login verification.
**Home Page:** Upon successful login, you should be redirected to the Home page. Test the food listing, searching, and modal interactions for adding items to the cart.
**Settings Page:** Navigate to the Settings page and test the user profile update, address management, and payment details. Make sure the data is correctly retrieved from and sent to the db.json file.
**Confirm Order Page**: Add items to the cart, then proceed to the Confirm Order page. Verify that all cart items are displayed and that placing an order works as expected.
**Order Tracking Page**: After placing an order, navigate to the Order Tracking page. Test the order tracking and history functionality.
**Logout:** Test the logout functionality by clicking the logout button in the Navbar. Ensure that all session data is cleared, and you are redirected to the Login page.
5. **Check the db.json**
Inspect the db.json file after each action to ensure that data is being stored and updated correctly.
6. Testing Edge Cases
**Invalid Inputs:** Try registering with invalid or missing data.
**Empty Cart:** Attempt to confirm an order with an empty cart.
**Unauthorized Access:** Try accessing pages like Settings or Order Tracking without logging in.
**Session Expiry:** Manually clear local storage or session data and test the appâ€™s behavior.
